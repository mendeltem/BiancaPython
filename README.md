pip install bianca-python

Usage

Here's an example of how you can use Bianca_python for brain image analysis:

python

import bianca_python as bp

# Load brain image data
data = bp.load_data('data.nii.gz')

# Perform data cleaning
data = bp.handle_missing_values(data)
data = bp.handle_outliers(data)
data = bp.handle_inconsistent_data(data)

# Perform feature engineering
data = bp.feature_extraction(data)
data = bp.feature_transformation(data)

# Perform statistical analysis
bp.descriptive_statistics(data)
bp.hypothesis_testing(data)
bp.regression_analysis(data)

# Create visualizations
bp.plot_bar_chart(data)
bp.plot_line_chart(data)
bp.plot_scatter_plot(data)
